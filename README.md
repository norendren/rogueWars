## Introduction
RogueWars is a submission for the 7 Day Roguelike Challenge 2020 (7DRL). It is essentially a fully reskinned version of the classic Drug Wars/Dope Wars game made popular on the TI-83+ calculators.

In RogueWars, you take on the roll of a Roguelike merchant. However, this roguelike merchant has been granted the ability to travel *between* different roguelike games, in pursuit of buying high and selling low to unsuspecting roguelike adventurers!

The ability to travel between roguelikes comes at a terrible cost (literally), because if you aren't able to purchase the Yendorian Wallet of Immortality within 30 arbitrary units of time then the **EVIL_BOSS_MAN** will turn you into a useless food merchant, hardly ever useful to even the newest of roguelike players.

## Gameplay

You are given a scant offering of goods to start out your journey. Make the most of them, as they will become your starting capital!

Throughout your playthrough, you will be wheeling and dealing in a variety of good, but for simplicity's sake they fall into the the 6 categories below. Their prices will range from the lowest documented price, up to the highest, as well as a rare chance for any given category to be significantly above or below even that!

| Item      | Lowest Normal Price | Highest Normal Price |
| --------- | :-----------------: | :------------------: |
| YWI*      |       200,000       |       200,000        |
| Artifacts |        1500         |         3000         |
| Wands     |         500         |         1400         |
| Armor     |         100         |         450          |
| Weapons   |         30          |          90          |
| Scrolls   |          7          |          25          |
| Potions   |          1          |          6           |

\*Yendorian Wallet of Immortality

Prices fluxuate greatly over the natural course of an adventurers lifetime in a roguelike dungeon....even more so with the chance for further chaos as you teleport through time and space to visit them!
